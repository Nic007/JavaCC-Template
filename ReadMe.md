# JavaCC Template for Intellij Idea and AnT

This template is a simple project that integrate correctly JavaCC to an IDE. You can now finally work in Intellij and simply press the Compile/Run buttons and enjoy. To make it works, an Ant step has been added before the compilation. Finally, the support for the visitors is present by default and a test-suite using JUnit is present and make it easy to test your parser.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to simply open this project in Intellij Idea and the project should be ready to run.

If you don't have Intellij installed, you will still need to install the correct version of JUnit and hamcrest and update the paths in the build.xml file. After this simply use the make file (**make compile/run/all/test**)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
JavaCC 1.7 (Included in the libs folder)
Intellij Idea
JUnit 4.12 (Included in Intellij)
Hamcrest 1.3 (Included in Intellij)
```

## Running the tests

To test your program in Intellij, you have two options. You can run/debug the Main.main() on a specific file or you can execute the tests.

If you want to simply execute the parser on a file, edit the run configurations of Main.main to add a program argument corresponding to the path of the file you want to analyze.

If you want to run all tests, you can simply right click the **test** folder (which is supposed to be green) in intellij and press **Run all tests**.

If you don't want to use Intellij, you can still execute the tests with the command **make test**.

## Built With

* [JavaCC](https://javacc.org/doc) - The Parser
* [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) - The pre-compile steps
